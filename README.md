#### About Me

I'm inspired by dynamic learning. 

I'm a 4th year French and Business Co-op student at the University of Waterloo. Originally from Mississauga, Ontario, I have nearly two years of marketing experience in software, engineering consulting, and e-commerce in the GTA.


I view myself as more than what my traditional education entails. Through my studies and experience, I am an observer of culture. It allows me to have a critical view of the world around me and the many networks and systems in place. I believe in clear and concise communication. When faced with a problem, I tackle it with creativity and realistic measures.
